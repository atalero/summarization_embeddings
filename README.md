# Comparing Embeddings for Text Summarization   
Code for improving the [CL 2017 paper "Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368) Different forms of word embeddings are integrated into the text summarization model. This code includes changes to the [repo](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator) by the paper's authors. It also has a modified version of a code for this [repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py) from skipgram training.

See our paper [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pxeDOwwq3jP1M4OduLe3m--TK86mhHxg).

## Summary
The Get to the Point Text Summarization algorithm uses a mix of abstractive and extractive methods for the task of text summarization on the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset, which you can download [here](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail). This program adds different embedding mechanisms to the Get to the Point Text Summarization Algorithm. Our code allows for the running of the following:
* **Baseline Model (same as original Get to the Point Code)**
* **Word2Vec (Skipgram) - Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)**

	We trained these vectors on a subset of our data (~40,000 article, 30 million words) with an embedding dimension dimension of 300.

* **GloVe Embeddings - Global Vectors for Word Representation [paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)**

	The dataset we used is 300 dimensional vectors from glove.6B.zip which can be downloaded [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). 

* **ELMo - Deep contextualized word representations - [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)** 

	This method uses task specific learning. ELMo returns three vectors (one from ELMo embeddings baed on character convolutions, one for a forward language model, backward language model), our model learns the correct task specific weights as defined in the paper.

## Instructions for Training
* run on tf version 1.13.1 
* this version uses Python 3.7
* use ```requirements.txt``` which was produced from our virtual environment (it may include more dependencies than needed).
* **NOTE that you must change the ```emb_dim``` flag to the dimensions of the vector embedding you are using**

All methods have the same function call (see [repo](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator) for more details) :

```
python run_summarization.py --mode=train --data_path=/path/to/chunked/train_* --vocab_path=/path/to/vocab --log_root=/path/to/a/log/directory --exp_name=myexperiment --<desired method>= True
```

<desired_method> can be any of the following:
* ```elmo```
* ```glove```
* ```bert```
* ```skipgram```

To only run a baseline model, you simply do not specify a flag for any of these. Note that GLoVe and Word2Vec methods will require data preprocessing. Follow the steps below produce the embedding matrices for both.

**GloVe**

To produce all the embedding matrices and save them to the local directory, run: 

```glove.py <glove_file_name> <path/to/vocab/file> <path/to/save/embedding/pickle> <embedding_dimension(int)>```

This script will produce a pickle file with all the word embeddings, which will then be loaded into ```run_summarization.py```.

Then add ```--glove_file=<glove_file_name>``` as a flag to run_summarization.py. i.e.

```
python run_summarization.py --mode=train --data_path=/path/to/chunked/train_* --vocab_path=/path/to/vocab --log_root=/path/to/a/log/directory --exp_name=myexperiment --glove= True --glove_file=<glove_file_name>
```
**Word2Vec (skipgram)**

To produce all the embedding matrices and save them to the local directory in lag folder. Additionally the directory of the chucked data, along with embedding dimension size and number of file to read are taken as input. The default embeddin size is 300 and default number of iles is 20, the log directory is a "log" folder in the same directory and it will try to look for data in the "data" directory in the same folder if none is specified.

run: 

```python skip.py --file_dir==/path/to/chunked/train_* --emb_num=300 --num_chunks=20```

This script will produce two pickle files, onw will be the embedding matrix and the second will be the labels. These in turn will be used by the emb.py file to produce the word embeddings for the model. To create the final word embeddings run the meb.py file specifying path to vocab file and also the directory for the embedding file from the previous code which will be in a folder named "log". Additionally, you could also specifiy the vocabulary size which by default is 50000. Run:

```python emb.py --vocab_file=/path/to/vocab --emb_dir=./log --v_size==50000```

This file with produce a pickle file of word embeddings in the same directory which our model will be expecting. This will then be loaded into ```run_summarization.py```.

```
python run_summarization.py --mode=train --data_path=/path/to/chunked/train_* --vocab_path=/path/to/vocab --log_root=/path/to/a/log/directory --exp_name=myexperiment --skipgram= True
```

## Instructions for Testing
Testing (decoding) works exactly like it does in the [baseline repo](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator) (visit the **Run beam search decoding** and **Evaluate with ROUGE** sections of README.md.
